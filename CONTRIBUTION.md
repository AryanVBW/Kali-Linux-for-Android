## How to Contribute

Here are ways you can help:

### Reporting bugs

- Check existing issues to see if your bug is already reported.
- If not, open a new issue with:
  1. A clear, descriptive title.
  2. Steps to reproduce the issue.
  3. Expected vs. actual behavior.
  4. Screenshots or logs (if applicable).
  5. Environment details (Android version, device model, app version, etc.)

### Suggesting features / enhancements

- Search existing issues and pull requests to avoid duplicates.
- Open a new issue with:
  - What you want to see (clear description).
  - Why it’s important / what problem it solves.
  - Any rough ideas on how it could be implemented.

### Submitting pull requests (PRs)

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b my-feature`).
3. Make commits with meaningful messages.
4. Ensure your changes include tests (if applicable).
5. Run existing tests and ensure nothing breaks.
6. Push your branch to your fork.
7. Open a PR against the **main** branch of this repository.
8. In the PR description, include:
   - What changes you made.
   - Why the changes are needed.
   - Any related issues (use “Closes #<issue_number>” if your PR fixes an issue).

A maintainer will review and provide feedback. Be patient; reviews may take time.

## Development Setup

Here is a suggested setup (you may adjust as needed):

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/AryanVBW/Kali-Linux-for-Android.git
   cd Kali-Linux-for-Android

2. **Install dependencies / tools**

   * (List out any dependencies, SDKs, libraries, commands, e.g. `apt-get`, `pkg`, Python modules, Android NDK, etc.)
   * Eg:

     ```sh
     sudo apt-get install <needed_packages>
     ```

3. **Build / Run locally / On device**

   * Steps to build the Android app / scripts / components.
   * How to test on an emulator or physical device.

4. **Testing / Validation**

   * Run unit tests (if any).
   * Manual testing guidelines.
   * Linting, static analysis, etc.

You can add a `docs/` folder or `scripts/` folder for setup scripts and documentation to help contributors.

---

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

* Use **clear, concise commit messages**, usually in the format:

  ```
  <type>(<scope>): <short description>

  <optional longer description>
  ```

  Where `<type>` can be:

  * `feat` — a new feature
  * `fix` — bug fix
  * `docs` — documentation changes
  * `style` — formatting / style changes (doesn’t affect functionality)
  * `refactor` — code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
  * `test` — adding or changing tests
  * `chore` — maintenance or tooling changes

* Keep changes in one PR focused. Avoid mixing unrelated changes.

* Write code such that it is readable, maintainable, and tested (where applicable).

* If your change is large or complex, discuss via issue first before implementing.

---

## Coding Style & Best Practices

While this may depend on the language(s) in use (shell, Python, Java/Kotlin, etc.), here are general guidelines:

* Use consistent indentation (tabs vs spaces) — pick one and stick to it.
* Name variables, functions, classes meaningfully.
* Write small, well-purposed functions / modules.
* Document public APIs, modules, and complex logic with comments or docstrings.
* Avoid global state when possible.
* Handle errors gracefully.
* Be careful about security — in an environment dealing with low-level or root operations (as in Kali tools), validate inputs, minimize privilege escalation, etc.

You may include or link to language-specific linters or style guides (e.g. `.eslintrc`, `pylintrc`, `ktlint`, etc).

---

## Testing

* Wherever possible, include unit tests or integration tests.
* Ensure PRs do not break existing tests.
* Use automation (CI / GitHub Actions) to run tests, linting, and checks on every push/PR.
* If you add a test, describe how to run it in documentation.

## License & Copyright

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the same license as this project (specify — e.g. **MIT**, **GPLv3**, etc.).
Make sure to indicate any file headers or copyright notices as needed.

## Getting Help / Contact

* If you have questions, post in Issues or Discussions.
* You can tag maintainers or people who are active in the project.
* Feel free to ask for review or guidance before implementing big features.
